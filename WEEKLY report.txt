I learned the history of the internet of thing that includes the debut of IOT in the world, development of IOT and outlook, flaws of IOT. Then I find the some information about technical of route in IOT and framwork of IOT. In common, framwork of IOT has three or four layers: there are  sensing layer, network layer and application layer from bottom to top; the four layer architecture is composed of sensing device layer (or sensing layer), network connection layer (or network layer), platform tool layer and application service layer. The most important is applications of IOT that is includes six aspects: consumers, industrial engineering, agriculture, business, infrastructure and military. In the end, I discover there are many problems in OIT, and I concern about the security. Through the learning of the IOT security, poor facilities and funding gaps are major sources of the problem.
